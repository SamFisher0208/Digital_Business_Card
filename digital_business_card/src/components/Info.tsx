      <p className="about">
        Hey there, I'm Sam and I'm thrilled to jump into the dynamic realm of
        web developement.
        <br />
        <br />
        After spending four years in administrative roles in Higher Ed, I felt a
        calling to pursue a career that would rekindle that childhood excitement
        of building and creating.

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p className="interests">
        Apart from my professional life, I have a great passion for art. Iâ€™ve
        been studying traditionally and digitally for the past 10 years,
        designing characters, logos, and environments for fun and for clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        Frontend development offers me the perfect opportunity to continually
        learn, grow, and harness my passion for crafting user-friendly and
        visually appealing digital experiences. It's a world where creativity
        meets technology, and I can't wait to dive in!
